# 📊 Excel Contact Form Setup Instructions

### 📊 Excel File Location
- **File**: `data/contact_submissions.xlsx`

## 🎯 How It Works

## 🧪 Testing

2. **Go to contact section**
3. **Fill out the form**
4. **Check the Excel file** in `data/contact_submissions.xlsx`
5. **Check console logs** for debugging info

## 📁 Accessing Your Data
